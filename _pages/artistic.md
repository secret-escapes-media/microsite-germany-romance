  title: Nuremberg
  description: Once the chosen seat of German kings, Nuremberg has always been a rather significant city in Germany's history. The cultural riches are evident; magnificent churches, rows of painted medieval buildings and a vast castle add a fairytale touch to any sightseeing wander. Treasures fill the city’s esteemed museums and galleries, steeped in a culture of flourishing arts – Albrecht Dürer lived here, one of the most significant Renaissance artists outside of Italy. Cafes and Bierkellers buzz with excitement, with grand squares a focal point of community revelry. Nuremberg is a wonderfully historic and culturally-charged destination.

      title: Culinary Delights
      description: Nuremberg is no stranger to culinary deliciousness. Age-old brewing traditions, Franconian wines and hearty dishes make the city a great foodie destination. Tuck into warm Bretzels as you explore the town, and pick up a healthy portion of the sweet Lebkuchen. Restaurants whip up Franconian classics like pork shoulder (Schäufele). Perhaps most iconic is the Nürnberger Bratwurst. For a truly historic bite, head for Bratwurstglöcklein im Handwerkerhof (a wursty mouthful of a name) where the beloved bratwurst has been served since 1313.

      title: Medieval Romance
      description: Though the war destroyed a great many of Nuremberg’s old buildings, they were painstakingly rebuilt brick-by-brick. It’s undeniable that the city retains its old-world grandeur; turrets and spires, brightly-painted timber-framed shops, and of course, the Imperial Castle. Marvel at the rich interiors and intricate facades of the city’s three medieval churches, the Frauenkirche, St Lorenz, and the oldest, the 13th-century St Sebalduskirche. Walk the old city walls, discover at the ostentatious 14th-century fountain in the Main Market Square, and have a famous red beer in the river-spanning, 700-year-old hospital-turned-bar.

      title: High Art
      description: Nuremberg is a champion of the arts, historically and to this day. The city’s most famous artist, Albrecht Dürer, had his home and workshop here, now lovingly restored and open to the public. He was Germany’s most important Renaissance artist – see how he lived, then pop along to the impressive Germanic National Museum to see some of his best works, alongside luminaries like Veit Stoß and Rembrandt. For something a little more modern, head to the Neues Museum, which traces the history of design from the post-war era to the present day.

    title: Trier
    description: The oldest city in Germany is filled with UNESCO sites, from ancient Roman bath complexes and vast Gothic churches. Set on the banks of the Mosel and surrounded by vine-clad hills, the old town is a heady mix of histories, with Roman relics galore (impressively preserved) rubbing shoulders with medieval masterpieces. Highlights include the vast Roman gate, the Porta Nigra, and the Gothic sprawl of Germany’s oldest cathedral.

    title: Potsdam
    description: Slung between two arms of the Havel river, Potsdam is a grandiose aristocratic playground, a statement to the power of Brandenburg. Surprisingly close to Berlin, the UNESCO world heritage site mixes dazzling palaces and beguiling landscaped gardens, earning it the moniker the German Versailles. But it’s not all Baroque pomp; explore the Dutch Quarter, filled with red-brick boutiques and cafes, or take a peek at the Tudor-revival Russian Quarter. From beguiling parklands and palaces, to architecturally diverse neighbourhoods filled with great dining and drinking options, Potsdam is a surprising Berlin outlier.

    title: Bremen
    description: Bremen is a dynamic mix of styles and tastes, where history and modernity rub shoulders to create impressive cultural pursuits. Quaint medieval streets hide down-to-earth bars and cute cafes, riverside promenades are the setting of flea markets and beer gardens, and artisan workshops line the art deco streets of Bremen’s expressionist quarter. With so much going on it might be surprising to hear that Bremen has a casual, village feel to it; a quality that makes for a truly inspired weekend away.

    title: Görlitz
    description: Pastel baroque facades line cobbled streets, art nouveau public buildings evoke an old-world grandeur, and an east-meets-west split diversifies the town further. Having emerged unscathed from war, Görlitz is a playbook of architectural styles. It now shares its cultural wonders with the Polish half of Görlitz, just a bridge away across the flowing Lusatian Neisse river. Embrace this unique cultural offering with a romantic walk along the scenic embankment, taking in views of both sides of the city...

  title: Aschaffenburg
  description: A town of parks and palaces, cobbles and colour, Aschaffenburg is a little-known riverside gem. Its iconic landmark is the vast, terracotta Renaissance palace, which dominates the shoreline and hints at the lavish architecture that makes the town so picturesque. The old town is a mix of narrow cobbled lanes and pastel timber-frame buildings, with Bavarian charm in abundance. Sink into bierkellers for frothy pilsners and hearty eats, hop between art galleries and take romantic strolls through landscaped riverside parks. Aschaffenburg is a pretty and peaceful place perfect for spoiling your loved one.

      title: Parks & Palaces
      description: Aschaffenburg is home to a wonderful collection of landscaped gardens. These picture-perfect greenspaces are typically crowned by a lavish palace. Park Schönbusch, cut in the English style, is awash with neo-classical touches; bridges, temples and more hide amongst the trees, topped by the eponymous palace. From here, the view extends far across the river to Johannisburg Palace. The riverside park that stretches from Johannisburg is equally pretty. Follow the trails to discover the breakfast temple and Pompeiianum, with views across the Main accompanying your strolls. Finally, Schöntal Park shelters the romantic ruins of an old church and a truly remarkable magnolia grove, with your final stop at the old orangery promising beer-garden respite.

      title: Art
      description: A town that exudes wealth and glamour like Aschaffenburg deserves a collection of fine art. The town was home to German Renaissance artist Matthias Grünewald and famous Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Along with their works you can also discover considerable collections of Lucas Cranach the Elder’s Reformation paintings and a Christian Schad collection (the highly influential New Objectivity artist) that is the largest in the world. Indulge your visual senses in the beauty of these works across a network of incredible museums and galleries – Stiftsmuseum, Jesuit Church, Neuer Kunstverein and many more.

      title: Food
      description: Eat like a Franconian. Sink into a cosy Wirtshaus and get gemutlich, as a platter of Bavarian favourites fills the table. An off-the-beaten-path destination like Aschaffenburg is perfect for getting traditional with locals, without the touristy fanfare that, for example, Munich’s Gasthäuse can be guilty of. Don’t miss the legendary Schlappeseppel brewhouse for your hearty fix of local fixtures, and when the wurst gets too stuffy, opt for a more modern destination like pier18. With the highest concentration of watering holes in the whole of Bavaria (no mean feat), drink your way across town sampling delicious frothy pilsners and famed Franconian wines.

    title: Erfurt
    description: Towering Gothic spires mark the skyline of Erfurt. A proud city with a long history, explore a medieval heart where colourful timber buildings add classic German romance to your twilight strolls. The architectural highlight has to be the Merchant’s Bridge, a lengthy proposition lined on each side by those same half-timbered houses, now sporting shops filled with trinkets and handmade goods. As the sun sinks, head for a host of cafes and restaurants for unforgettable evenings with surprising contemporary touches.

    title: Saarburg
    description: Hidden in the verdant hills of Rhineland-Palatinate in an area of vineyards and cellar-door tastings, Saarburg is spectacular, peculiar, and irresistibly beautiful. On the banks of the Saar river, the town rises steeply, dissected by the small Leukbach river. Saarburg takes full advantage of this; al fresco dining and drinking lines both sides of the narrow river, before a long waterfall interrupts the scene. Viewpoints and a small bridge make the best of the scene, one that is imbued with a drama and beauty totally unique to this quaint German town.

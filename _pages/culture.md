  title: Nuremberg
  description: Once the chosen seat of German kings, Nuremberg has always been a rather significant city in Germany's history. The cultural riches are evident; magnificent churches, rows of painted medieval buildings and a vast castle add a fairytale touch to any sightseeing wander. Treasures fill the city’s esteemed museums and galleries, steeped in a culture of flourishing arts – Albrecht Dürer lived here, one of the most significant Renaissance artists outside of Italy. Cafes and bierkellers buzz with excitement, with grand squares a focal point of community revelry. Nuremberg is a wonderfully historic and culturally-charged destination.

      title: Wurst
      description: Maybe not the most romantic meal out there, but if culture is what your interested in then wurst is what you’re going to get. Nuremberg is famed for its eponymous sausage, a foodie tradition that goes back centuries. You’ll find it dished up across town, from the street imbiss to the biergarten, but the formula remains unchanged. For a truly historic bite, head for Bratwurstglöcklein im Handwerkerhof ( a wursty mouthful of a name) where the beloved bratwurst has been dished up since 1313. That’s over 700 years of wurst and culture, served on a deliciously cabbage-y pewter plate.

      title: Medieval Romance
      description: Though the war destroyed a great many of Nuremberg’s old buildings, many were painstakingly rebuilt brick-by-brick. It’s undeniable that the city retains its old-world grandeur; turrets and spires, brightly-painted timber-framed shops, and of course, the grand castle. Marvel at the rich interiors and intricate facades of the city’s three medieval churches, the Frauenkirche, St Lorenz, and the oldest, the 13th-century St Sebalduskirche. Walk the old city walls, marvel at the ostentatious 14th-century fountain in the main square, and have a beer in the river-spanning, 700-year-old hospital-turned-bar.

      title: 20th Century History
      description: There’s no escaping Nuremberg’s dark past. But confronting it and understanding it is something the modern city excels at. The nazi parade grounds are an interesting spectacle, their vastness and striking architecture adding context to the megolomanical rallies of the thirties. The nearby Documentation Centre goes even further, with an incredible exhibition delving into the cult of personality of Hitler. Then there’s the eponymous trials; a visit to the courtroom is a good way to round off any sift through this dark past, where justice prevailed and Germany began to start on its journey of rebuilding itself into the vibrant, diverse and brilliant place that it is today.

    title: Trier
    description: The oldest city in Germany is filled with UNESCO sites, from ancient Roman bath complexes and vast Gothic churches. Set on the banks of the Mosel and surrounded by vine-clad hills, the old town is a heady mix of histories, with Roman relics galore (impressively preserved) rubbing shoulders with medieval masterpieces. Highlights include the vast Roman gate, the Porta Nigra, and the Gothic sprawl of Germany’s oldest cathedral.

    title: Potsdam
    description: Slung between two arms of the Havel river, Potsdam is a grandiose aristocratic playground, a statement to the power of Brandenburg. Surprisingly close to Berlin, the UNESCO world heritage site mixes dazzling palaces and beguiling landscaped gardens, earning it the moniker the German Versailles. But it’s not all Baroque pomp; explore the Dutch Quarter, filled with red-brick boutiques and cafes, or take a peek at the Tudor-revival Russian Quarter. From beguiling parklands and palaces, to architecturally diverse neighbourhoods filled with great dining and drinking options, Potsdam is a surprising Berlin outlier.

    title: Bremen
    description: Bremen is a dynamic mix of styles and tastes, where history and modernity rub shoulders to create impressive cultural pursuits. Cobbled and labyrinthine medieval lanes hide down-to-earth bars and cute cafes, riverside promenades are the setting of flea markets and beer gardens, and artisan workshops line the art deco streets of Bremen’s expressionist quarter. With so much going on it might be surprising to hear that Bremen has a casual, village feel to it; a quality that makes for a truly inspired weekend away.

    title: Görlitz
    description: Pastel baroque facades line cobbled streets, art nouveau public buildings evoke an old-world grandeur, and an east-meets-west split diversifies the town further. Emerging unscathed from world wars, Görlitz is a playbook of architectural styles; but the war did leave one scar, one that now makes for a fascinating cultural hotbed. The river is now the border between Germany and Poland, with the now Polish half of Görlitz just a bridge away...

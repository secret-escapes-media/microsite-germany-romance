  id: heidelberg
  title: Heidelberg
  description: Heidelberg is just one of those picture-perfect towns. Surrounded by dark-green forest, slung along a sparkling river and overlooked by a gothic-cum-renaissance castle perched high on a hill, an image of Heidelberg stirs the inner romantic. Also the real Romantics; William Turner and Goethe were both totally infatuated with the place, crafting verse and landscapes that capture the wild beauty of the town. As Goethe put it, “The town with its location and beautiful surroundings, has, one may say, something special.” Discover this for yourself by wandering the cobbled streets of the marvellous baroque old town and sinking into the historic student atmosphere, centred around Germany’s oldest university.

      title: Schloss Heidelberg
      description: The town’s most romantic asset, the renaissance red-stone marvel paints an evocative shape on Heidelberg’s skyline. And, of course, the temptation is there to get a closer look. It’s a steep climb to the top, but the views are unmissable. Best to head there just before sunset and pitch a spot in the castle grounds, where a blanket and some wine will be the perfect aperitif to start the evening.

      title: Funicular
      description: Views and more views. In a place as pretty as Heidelberg, there’s nothing quite like discovering another gorgeous vista to enjoy with your loved one. Also, nothing beats a funicular. Step into the old wooden carriage as it climbs high to the King’s Throne, the peak of a mountain that towers over Heidelberg. Up here, the views are magnificent, stretching beyond the town and river valley.
    - id: student-pubs
      title: Student Pubs
      description: The title may sound daunting but Heidleberg’s student pubs are an institution. With a university heritage as old as this, there’s a strong selection of old-world pubs to sink a few pilsners in. Zum Roten Ochsen is one of the oldest and most known, a wood-panelled delight where students have carved their names into the tables and walls for centuries. Plus, the menu is filled with traditional eats, for a wholesome night of convivial excess.

  - id: rothenburg
    title: Rothenburg
    description: This remarkable Bavarian village, with its topsy-turvy, bright and colourful medieval buildings and narrow, twisting, picturesque streets, is as fairytale pretty as it gets. Surrounded by high walls and tall, round turrets, Rothenburg is a time capsule of picture-perfect sights slung on the famed Romantic Way. For all-out romance, don’t miss this classic slice of medieval beauty.
    airport: Nuremberg Airport
  - id: lubeck
    title: Lübeck
    description: Once lauded as the Queen of the Hanse, Lübeck was a very important trading centre in the Middle Ages. Like any wealthy old town, this means one thing; a set of gorgeous old buildings, grand churches, round towers and centuries-old cosmopolitan flair. Though fairly big, Lübeck is wonderfully laid-back, with riverside ambles, historic restaurants and chilled out pubs to explore.
    airport: Hamburg Airport
  - id: rudesheim
    title: Rüdesheim
    description: Rüdesheim is a picture of typical Rhineland beauty. It’s this landscape that the Romantics fell for, a centrepiece to the Grand Tour. Medieval charms spill across the narrow Drosselgasse, where picturesque half-timber buildings tumble against each other. Visit a wine museum hidden in a 1,000-year-old castle in a region renowned for its delicious Rieslings, and set sail in the footsteps of Byron and Keats with a boat trip down the Rhine, in a portion of the river with the highest concentration of evocative and romantic riverside castles.

  - id: luneburg
    title: Lüneburg
    description: Wobbly spires and leaning buildings, dressed in typical medieval splendour, add a charming eccentricity to this romantic town. Once a Hanseatic salt-mining powerhouse (mining which caused the subsidence of a great many buildings), Lüneburg offers a jumble of pretty streets with plenty of historic sights. Head to the riverside for al fresco dining and throw yourself into the town’s buzzing night scene, propped up by a youthful student population.

  title: Baden-Baden
  description: Baden-Baden is the most famous spa town in Germany, with an old-world grandeur and style unparalleled. Sink into the finer things, where gorgeous thermal baths sit alongside opera houses and colourful belle-epoque townhouses. If you can bear to tear yourself away from the thermal waters of Baden-Baden’s many spas, you can indulge in boutique shopping, Michelin dining, and sampling wines from the region that surrounds it. If that’s not enough, head into the nearby Black Forest for truly beguiling outdoor adventure.

      description: It was the Romans who first discovered Baden-Baden’s unique waters. Since then, the town has thrived as a wellness hotspot, attracting royalty and jet-setters for centuries. Join them – you deserve it after all. Head for timeless opulence at the famed Friedrichsbad, or sink into the pinnacle of spa refinement at the incredible Caracalla Spa. Or do both. Definitely both.

      description: "When a town attracts presidents and queens, it needs a selection of fine restaurants; Baden-Baden is set to whet the appetite of even the most discerning gourmet geek. For out-and-out finesse, head for Baden-Baden’s two Michelin-starred restaurants: Le Jardin de France and Röttele’s Restaurant in Neuweier Castle. And what to wash it down with? The surrounding vineyards produce an excellent Riesling, finished with the iconic Black Forest Gateau."

Baden-Baden is the perfect springboard for adventures into the forest sprawl, conveniently located to get you quickly into the heart of the area’s most dramatic scenes.

    title: Aachen
    description: In Aachen, history is palpable; it’s long, it’s grand, it’s rich and it’s pan-European. It was the Romans, once again, who spotted the thermal waters here and built a settlement, but it was Charlemagne who put Aachen on the map. The vast gothic spires of the cathedral signal the piety of Aachen’s medieval past, but nowadays it’s totally okay to indulge oneself in the hearty old town Brauhäuser and, of course, the exceptional spa facilities at lauded spots like Carolus Thermen.

    title: Wiesbaden
    description: One of Europe’s oldest spa towns has plenty of experience with offering superlative wellness escapes. Walk bustling streets lined by art nouveau townhouses and neo-classical mansions, dipping in and out of boutiques and charming cafes that flank grand boulevards. Round off your day’s exploration with a dip in the old thermal springs, particularly the opulent and historic Kaiser Friedrich baths.

    title: Sylt
    description: Attached to the mainland by a narrow causeway, the small crescent island in the North Sea is a true escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. A favourite amongst honeymooners, the rolling green-topped dunes, candy-striped lighthouses and thatched cottages that define the landscape create a peaceful setting for a wellness retreat. But there’s also glamour in abundance; boutique shopping, Michelin-starred restaurants and fashionable spa retreats make Sylt a perfect weekend sojourn for total revitalisation.

    title: Mainau
    description: Forget the bouquet, gift a whole flower island; or at least a visit to one. Mainau, an islet in the charming Lake Constance, is a technicolour wonder; wander the landscaped garden-island – dreamed up by the Bernadotte family – with a baroque castle thrown in for good measure. Steal a kiss in the enchanting Butterfly House and walk the gardens, with gorgeous lake views to one side and sprawling flower beds to the other.
